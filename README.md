## General Description
This repository organizes and stores the files and notes for each course assignment. Each submission includes an executable Python file or a Jupyter Notebook with detailed comments.

## Rationale for Using the Main Branch
I chose to keep everything on the **main branch** to simplify workflow. Since this repository focuses on sequential and related assignments, a single main branch helps keep the history clean and centralized, making collaboration and review easier.

## Versions and Configuration

### Python Version
For all the course assignments, I am using **Python 3.12.5**. Maintaining the same version avoids compatibility issues with libraries and ensures project reproducibility.

### Libraries Used
Throughout the assignments, various Python libraries were used to facilitate data analysis and processing. These include:
- **pandas**: for data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: for numerical operations and array handling.
- **matplotlib**: for data visualization.
- **shutil**: for file system operations (e.g., copying files).
- **scipy**: for scientific computing.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1
- **File**: `ENTREGA 1.ipynb`
- **Description**: This assignment covers the use of basic Python concepts and their application in data processing.
- **Objectives**: 
  - Learn Python fundamentals.
  - Implement control structures and basic functions.

### Assignment 2
- **File**: `ENTREGA 2.py`
- **Description**: This assignment focuses on a classic **FizzBuzz** exercise, where a function is created to print different outputs depending on whether a number is a multiple of 3, 5, or both.
- **Objectives**: 
  - Create the function `fizzbuzz(n)`.
  - Print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both, or the number itself otherwise.
  - Run the function for values from 1 to 20.

### Assignment 3
- **File**: `ENTREGA 3.ipynb`
- **Description**: This assignment explores Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, covering topics like classes, objects, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Objectives**: 
  - Define and use classes and objects in Python.
  - Apply concepts of abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### Assignment 4
- **File**: `ENTREGA 4.ipynb`
- **Description**: This assignment introduces **Basic Libraries I** for data science, including Numpy for numerical operations and Scipy for scientific computing.
- **Objectives**: 
  - Use Numpy for mathematical operations.
  - Apply Scipy for scientific calculations.
  - Explore additional libraries like `math`, `os`, `glob`, and `shutil`.

### Assignment 5
- **File**: `ENTREGA 5.ipynb`
- **Description**: This assignment covers **Basic Libraries II** and explores data handling with `json`, `pickle`, and `parquet` formats, as well as libraries for regular expressions and date-time processing.
- **Objectives**: 
  - Work with `json`, `pickle`, and `parquet` file formats.
  - Use the `re` library for regular expressions.
  - Handle date and time with `time` and `datetime`.

### Assignment 6
- **File**: `ENTREGA 6.ipynb`
- **Description**: This assignment is an introduction to **Datasets** with Pandas, covering loading and exploring datasets, and data cleaning.
- **Objectives**: 
  - Use Pandas to load and analyze datasets.
  - Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

### Assignment 7
- **File**: `ENTREGA 7.ipynb`
- **Description**: This assignment extends the work with Pandas, diving into advanced data manipulation, handling missing data, and data transformations.
- **Objectives**: 
  - Utilize lambda functions and mapping techniques.
  - Explore Pandas series.
  - Perform data transformations and manage missing data.

## Interpretations and Learnings
While developing each assignment, I interpreted and applied key Python concepts, such as data manipulation, use of functions, and control structures. Some of the main learnings include:
- **Code structuring**: The importance of writing readable and modular code.
- **Function optimization**: Improving operation efficiency through specific libraries.
- **Documentation**: Adding comments and documenting code effectively to facilitate review.
